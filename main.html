            <strong>Inception</strong> (2010) is a science-fiction heist film directed by Christopher Nolan.
            The story follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in extracting secrets
            from people's subconscious during dream states. Cobb is offered a chance to have
            his criminal record erased if he can successfully perform an almost-impossible task:
            <em>plant</em> an idea into someone's mind (inception) rather than steal one.
            The film explores themes of memory, grief, reality vs. illusion, and the ethics of manipulating minds.
